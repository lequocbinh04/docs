**Step 1.** Make sure that you have all below information:

|     Name     |       Description        |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| `Merchant key` | Key to identify your website          |
| `Secret key`   | Key to sign your message |
| `Checksum key` | Key to verify message    |

**Step 2.** Create a new transaction with below api:

 <Card
    title="Payment"
    icon="credit-card"
    href="/api-reference/endpoint/payment"
  >
    Create new transaction
  </Card>

**Step 3.** After create transaction successfully, you will get a `payment_url` in response. Redirect to this url to complete payment.

**Step 4.** User will continue payment process on **KB2A website**. After complete payment, user will be redirected to your website with below params:
|     Name     |       Description        |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| `result`     | Base64 encoded of json result    |
| `checksum`   | Checksum of above json with `Checksum key` |

Then you will need to send the data to server, at the server you **MUST** verify the checksum to make sure that the data is not modified. Sample code:

```go validateChecksum.go
dataToHash := result + CHECKSUM_KEY
hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(dataToHash))
sha256Data := fmt.Sprintf("%X", hash)

if !strings.EqualFold(checksum, sha256Data) {
  return "", fmt.Errorf("checksum not match")
}
// do something with result
```

**Step 5.** KB2A server will call Merchant server at the same time. Data: `result` and `checksum`

**Step 6.** After verify the checksum, merchant will continue to process the data.

<Warning>
KB2A server will not callback if transactions is expired.
