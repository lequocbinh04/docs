## Setup your Application

First please DM me via [@Cris](https://t.me/crisne99) on Telegram to approve your domain.

Currently, we support **2 domains** below:
- [kb2a.vn](https://kb2a.vn)
- [mindzone.me](https://mindzone.me)

## Integrate your application to with KB2A
### Frontend
You can implement login with KB2A as flow below:
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Validate with you server to check if user is logged in or not.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    If user is not logged in, redirect user to KB2A login page, with `to` query param is your app's login page (or any page you want to redirect user after login).

    E.g: `https://kb2a.vn/login?to=https://mindzone.me/callback/login`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    When user logged in, KB2A will redirect user to `to` query param with `token` query param. Then you will show a loading screen and send `token` to your server to validate.

    E.g: `https://mindzone.me/callback/login?token=v4.public.eyJ....`
  </Step>
</Steps>
### Backend
Create an endpoint that receive `token` from frontend and validate it with KB2A API (Get me query). 
If the token is valid, check if user exists in your database or not. If not, create a new user with information from KB2A API. Then set the token to cookie name `account`.

<Warning>
Remember:
- Must set `httpOnly` to `true` when set cookie. This will prevent XSS attack.
- Must set `secure` to `true` when set cookie. This will prevent MITM attack.
- Create a middleware to handle token, the information like `avatar`, `name`, `email` must be query from KB2A through gRPC.
- Must validate `Referer` or `Origin` header to prevent CSRF attack.
</Warning>
